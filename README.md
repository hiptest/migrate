# Zephyr project migration

## 1. Export Zephyr project.

The only way to retrieve the steps of each test case is to put all of them in a test cycle and to export that test cycle.
You can do it (bulk) by following these steps :

 1. Create a dedicated test cycle (called "All Tests" for example).

 2. In the 'Search Test' section, create a search filter ('save as' button at the top of the page) named 'All tests' that only filter the issueType to 'Test': 
 project=<projectId> AND issuetype=Test

 3. Press the 'All Tests' gear in the test cycle list, select "add tests", then enter the filter name 'All tests' in the 'search filter' pane. Validate.

 4. All your tests are now imported to the 'All Tests' test cycle. You should now be able to export the 'All Tests' test cycle from the 'Search test execution' page.

Finally, to have all test informations (like description, etc), could you please try to export all zephyr tests from the 'Search Test' page:

![export search tests](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/45689099/1d9fa06201754199006ffb3b/Capture+d%E2%80%99e%CC%81cran+2018-01-17+a%CC%80+15.04.03.png)

## 2. Execute script

Migration script needs some variable to push exported project to Hiptest:

 1. HT_ACCESS_TOKEN, HT_CLIENT, HT_UID: can be found in   your Hiptest profile page. Once you have them, export them in your shell session
 
 2. Hiptest can't create a project from API. You will have to create a project from Hiptest application then retrieve your project id in the URL : 'https://hiptest.net/app/projects/&lt;YOUR_PROJECT_ID&gt;/' and export it in the HT_PROJECT variable in your shell session.

Now you could launch the script with: 
```shell
./migrate_zephyr.rb export_file1.xml export_file2.xml
```

with export_file1.xml et export_file2.xml the two previously described Zephyr exports.
